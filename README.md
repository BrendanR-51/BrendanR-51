Hi! I'm Brendan Rood.
I am currently a student of computer science at the University of Minnesota Duluth.
I am a member of the XR Research team at this university, and in addition to ComputerScience projects, this will be my primary use of GitHub.
You can reach me at my student email: rood0039@umn.edu
